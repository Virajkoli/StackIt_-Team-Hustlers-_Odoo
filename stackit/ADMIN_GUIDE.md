The database seed script automatically creates an admin user with the following credentials:

- **Password**: `password123`
- **Role**: `ADMIN`

To create the admin user, run:
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### 2. Promoting Existing Users to Admin

Use the admin promotion script to make any existing user an admin:

```bash
# Promote by email
node scripts/promote-admin.js admin@stackit.com

# Promote by username
node scripts/promote-admin.js johndoe
```

### 3. Accessing the Admin Dashboard

- Maintain at least one admin user at all times

## Development Notes

### File Structure
```
/lib/adminAuth.js          # Admin authentication utilities
/api/admin/moderate/       # Content moderation endpoints
/api/admin/users/role/     # User role management endpoints
/app/admin/                # Admin dashboard pages
/components/AdminActions.js # Admin action buttons
/scripts/promote-admin.js   # Admin promotion utility
```

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables are required for admin functionality. The system uses the existing database and authentication configuration.

### Testing
1. Create test users with different roles
2. Test content moderation actions
3. Verify role promotion/demotion
4. Test admin dashboard functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Admin Dashboard Not Accessible
- **Verify user has ADMIN role in database**: Run `node scripts/promote-admin.js <email>` to promote user
- **Check authentication session**: Log out and log back in after role change
- **Ensure proper navigation to `/admin`**: Admin dashboard link appears in profile dropdown

#### Admin Actions Not Visible
- Confirm user is logged in as admin
- Check role in session data - may require logout/login after role change
- Verify AdminActions component is properly imported

#### Permission Errors
- Verify admin middleware is working
- Check database connection
- Ensure proper role assignment

#### Session Role Not Updating
If admin role changes don't appear immediately:
1. **Log out and log back in** - This refreshes the session with latest role
2. **Clear browser cache** if issues persist
3. **Verify role in database** using the promote script

**Note**: The authentication system now automatically fetches the latest user role on each session call, but existing sessions may need to be refreshed.
